    Amplicon libraries routinely carry adapter-dimer and primer-only fragments
    an order of magnitude shorter than the product. Those are real reads but not
    reads *of the amplicon*, and they make the length distribution bimodal —
    which is what breaks a low percentile.

    Measured on a real 18S library: 325 of 1,426 reads (22.8%) fell under 50 bp
    against a modal length of 232, so the 10th percentile landed at 31 bp, deep
    inside the fragment mode. Truncating there left 150 bp per read against a
    277 bp amplicon, and 99.5% of pairs then failed to merge — the sample
    vanished from the final table.

    Keeping only reads of at least `floor_frac` of the median restores a
    unimodal distribution, so the percentile measures what it is meant to. A
    read under half the typical length cannot carry the expected product anyway,
    and filterAndTrim would discard it regardless.

    full-length reads into oblivion.

    *min_length* floors the QUALITY position and nothing else. It exists so a
    quality dip at ~30bp cannot truncate reads below the length they need to
    overlap (issue #4). Applying it to the length cap instead asks for reads
    that were never sequenced: dada2 discards reads shorter than truncLen, so a
    floor above the library's real length silently returns zero reads for every
    sample. A 2x150 run whose amplicon reads are 126bp after primer removal was
    truncated at 148 and kept 607 of 101194 reads.
